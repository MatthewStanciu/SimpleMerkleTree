# SimpleMerkleTree
I'm learning about Merkle trees and I decided to make this just to familiarize myself with the idea.
I took some pointers from https://github.com/wobine/blackboard101/blob/master/IntroToMerkleRootsWBN.py, but I used it very little in actually writing the program.
If I dive deeper into this topic, I might update this, but currently my plan is to just leave this as it currently is forever and hopefully have it be here as a reference to anyone looking to learn about Merkle trees like I am.
